# Overview
Scripts for parsing Fun Fun class responses and randomly assigning classes to students. 

Since forever, our volunteer organization has assigned classes to students by hand, which is error prone and time consuming. In order to maintain data integrity and our sanities, I hope to automate our approach to class assignment.

# Timeline

1. Get 'hard coded' responses parsed and assigned classes to motivate general approach (1-2 days) (DONE! in archive folder)

2. Write reusable scripts for subsequent years (2 days) (in progress)

3. Incorporate into concurrent modernization of UEAA Fun Fun data collection (1 month, not including the time for this S E C R E T project)
